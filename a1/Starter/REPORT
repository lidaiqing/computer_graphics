CSC 418 - Assignment 1 Report File

In this file you must:

__________________________________________________________________
1) Describe *briefly* and *concisely* what parts of the assignment
   you found easier, harder, and/or tricky to get right

The easier part is to add control panels, and harder one is to draw

boids in 3D. The tricky part is when implementing the rule, it is easy

to forget initialize parameters.


__________________________________________________________________
2) Answer any //QUESTION: items noted in the code
QUESTION: Is this the optimal way to implement this  rule? can you see any problems or ways to improve this bit?
No. In this way, we need to calculate the distance for all boids each time we update its position. Actually the center of mass would not change that much for a frame. Maybe we could do some approximation or store distance informations to speed it up.
QUESTION: Why add inertia at the end and not at the beginning?
If we add inertia at the beginning, all the update rules are applied based on added inertia velocity. However, we should update based on current velocity instead of added version.



__________________________________________________________________
3) Describe any //CRUNCHY: extensions you implemented
I add a new feature about leaders. I randomly select 3 leaders and for every random update, it searches the closest leader in the list and update its velocity to fly toward it.

4) Briefly comment on the following:

a) What is the time complexity of the boid update (in big Oh notation),
   justify.
   O(n). For each update, we need to calculate all other boids' distance if we consider distance calculation takes constant time.
b) What could you do to make the update more efficient?
   We can keep track of which boids are within the distance to the current boid.
c) What is the greatest bottleneck of the program:

    Is it the boid update code?
    Or is it the boid display code?

    Why is that? justify your answer.
    I think it is boid update. Boid display is constant for each draw but update needs O(n) time to do calculation.
d) How would you adapt the idea behind Boids to swarms of running
   creatures (e.g. a herd of charging animals, an army of CGI
   monsters, a crowd of simulated humans walking). Think of the
   specific conditions you would need to add to the simulation
   that are different from your Boids implementation
   Depends on the natural of the creatures, they might have different actions and rules for movement. For example, humans have their own walking style and they are more organized comparing to the walking of monsters. Another thing is about the reaction to the environment. For example, if it is raining, simulation should display the reaction for creatures under such environment.
